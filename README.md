<!-- Places You've Been
Make a website where you can enter places that you have been. Test and build methods to add places, save places, display all of the places you've added.

Don't forget to start by writing unit specs and making them pass before starting on integration testing and Sinatra. Add in some CSS, make regular commits and add a README to your project. -->
